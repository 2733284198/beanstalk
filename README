BEANSTALK
---- A minimalistic PHP beanstalk client.

Synopsis
--------
This library allows you to interface with the beanstalk[1] work queue and is
built with a minimal featureset still supporting the complete protocol. The
main (and currently only) class can be found at `src/Socket/Beanstalk.php`.

The class was formerly part of the queue plugin for CakePHP[2]. It has been
extracted for higher reusability in other places and frameworks.
